RNA sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome or the respective NHP species from which the samples were derived. The 
resultant counts from either mapping method were then limited to genes with a one-to-one human ortholog (based off ENSEMBL ID) 
across all species, resulting in ~11,000 genes (referenced as “common orthologs” in the main text). For counts mapped to the 
NHP genomes, the human ortholog ENSEMBL ID was used for all subsequent analysis for ease of comparison. These counts were 
normalized using DESeq2 default options and finally transformed using the regularized log2 function in DESeq2. The first two 
components of the principal component analysis (PCA) are depicted here for either all ~11,000 genes (“common orthologs”) or 
for a subset of these genes which overlapped with those found in the database InnateDB (“innate genes”). Each point 
represents an individual donor and is colored by species as shown in the figure legend, with shades of blue indicating Great 
Ape species, shades of green Old World Monkeys and purple the single New World Monkey used in this study. Circles indicate 
mock-transfected samples and triangles poly(I:C)-transfected samples.

This contains the code and output for what comprises Fig2A-D in the manuscript.
