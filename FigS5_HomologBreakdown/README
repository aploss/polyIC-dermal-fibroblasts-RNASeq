For each of the non-human primate (NHP)species of interest, identifying via ENSEMBL's BioMart the type of ortholog 
relationship a given gene has with human. First, an ortholog "database" was made for the species of interest and this 
was then subsequently used to make plots showing the number of genes in a NHP species that was a one2one ortholog or 
one2many ortholog, etc. compared to human.
