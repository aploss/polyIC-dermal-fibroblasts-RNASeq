Code and output for figure S9. These data correspond with that shown in Figure 3 and delineates whether the genes that were 
found to be “unique” in their differential expression following poly(I:C) treatment compared to human was due to those genes 
having a one-to-one human ortholog only in that particular species or species group. Since the determination of one-to-one 
orthologs was done on a species-by-species basis prior to the analysis summarized in Figure 3, some genes could be found as 
“unique” to a species just because there was no one-to-one human ortholog in any of the other species. The upper left panel 
shows the “unique” genes amongst all the monkey species, the upper right panel that for the Old World monkeys and the bottom 
two rows those that were “unique” to individual species. The columns are colored based on the species as done throughout the 
rest of the manuscript and as shown in the figure legend. The first column for each grouped plot (or columns in the case of 
the upper two panels) is that of the species given in the plot title. The y axis shows the number of genes that have a one-to-
one human ortholog for each species. The maximum value is that of the first column (or group of columns for the upper two 
panels) and corresponds to the number of genes contained within that intersection as shown in Figure 3
