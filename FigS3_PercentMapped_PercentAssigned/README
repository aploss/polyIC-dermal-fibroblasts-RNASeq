The code and resultant image when analyzing the RNASeq data by either aligning the reads to the human or species-specific 
genome. The plot shows the percent of reads that were mapped/aligned when using one genome versus the other as a reference
and also the percent of reads assigned to a feature when using one genome versus the other.
