Comparing the top 500 most significantly differentially expressed genes between the two mapping methods. In the left column 
are the top 500 most significantly (based off padj value) differentially expressed genes found after using the species-
specific genome for mapping, with the genes arranged by increasing log2(FoldChange) for the species mapping method (shown in 
purple). The corresponding log2(FoldChange) for the same genes after using the human genome as the mapping reference are shown 
in green. The right column shows the inverse, with the coloring maintained, where the top 500 most significantly 
differentially expressed genes after mapping to the human genome are shown by increasing log2(FoldChange). Each row is a 
different species and the Spearman coefficient of the log2(FoldChange) values (after omitting any missing values of which 
there were no more than five) in each plot is shown. 
Data information: Genes are labeled with their gene symbol if any of the following criteria were met: (i) the ratio of the 
log2(FoldChange) from each method for a given gene was less than 0.67 or greater than 1.5 AND the absolute value of the 
log2(FoldChange) by at least one of the mapping methods was > 2; (ii) the log2(FoldChange) was determined as “NA” by the 
mapping method not used to create the list of 500 most significant genes; (iii) the padj value was missing or non-significant. 
For genes in the final category, the point and label are shown enlarged. Where no gene symbol was listed, the human ENSEMBL ID 
was used.
