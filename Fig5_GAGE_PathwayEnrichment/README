Read counts mapped to the human or species-specific genomes were limited on a species-by-species basis to the ENSEMBL IDs that 
had a one-to-one human ortholog (referenced as “species orthologs” in the main text). The resultant genes were then analyzed 
using Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment (GAGE), with the only genes excluded being those that lacked an ENTREZ ID (the 
IDs used by GAGE) and/or had a missing padj value. A heat map is shown of pathways (the row labels) with a q value < 0.09 for 
at least one species (the column labels), with the cells colored by –log10(q value) so that cells meeting the cutoff are 
shades of purple and those that do not are shades of orange (white is set to the –log10(0.09). Since genes were limited on a 
species-by-species basis to those that had a one-to-one human ortholog, each NHP species has a human profile that was limited 
to that same gene set (the eight right most columns of each heat map). The reads were derived from the same biological samples 
– only the downstream analysis differs in terms of the genes that were included by their ortholog status.
