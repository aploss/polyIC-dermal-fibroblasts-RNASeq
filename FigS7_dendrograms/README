This folder contains the code for generating the dendrograms made to visualize the hierarchical clustering of the samples  
shown in Fig S7 of the manuscript. RNA-Seq reads were aligned to either the human or the NHP-speciifc genome. 
The read counts were limited to those that have a one-to-one human ortholog across all species prior to undergoing the rlog 
function in DESeq2. After this was done, the subsequent output was limited to genes contained in the InnateDB list (and that 
consequently also fell on the one-to-one human ortholog list across all species). The samples, after these limitations, were 
then visualized as dendrograms to see how they compared to one another.
